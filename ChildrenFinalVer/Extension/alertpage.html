    <h1>What do I do about an alert? </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">Although it can be nerve-wracking
      to see that an alert was found, it does not necessarily mean that your child
      is doing anything unsafe. It is recommended that you visit the page where the
      alert was found and ensure that it is safe for your child.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="margin:100px;">
    <h1>What is an alert? </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">The PrivacyPanda Team came up with
      a list of alert words that we check website titles against. If a title contains
      any of these words, we notify you that an alert was found.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="margin:100px;">
    <h1>Which alert words do you use? </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">Our alert words are:

      "Porn", "Drug", "Weed", "Pot", "Suicide", "Drugs", "Sex", "Cannabis",
      "Hashish", "Hemp", "Herb", "Tea", "Help", "Ganja", "Hash", "Joint", "Reefer",
      "Doobie", "Loco Weed", "Porno", "Raunchy", "Steamy", "Sexy", "X-Rated", "xxx", "XXX", "Suicidal",
      "Self Mutilation", "Self-Mutilation", "Guns", "QAnon", "qanon", "Qanon", "Self-Injury", "marijuana".</p>
  </div>
  <div style="margin:100px;">
    <h1>Can I add an alert word? </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">Unfortunately we are not allowing
      users to create their own alert words at this time.</p>
